# Geometry

 This project helps to calculate the circle of Triangle and the primeter of Rectangle

 ## Overview 

 Here are quick explanations what I used in `Program.cs `file :

 * Console input/output
 * Converting data types
 * Do While Loop
 * `switch ` statement ->

 Case 1 

 ![](./Assets/case%201%20switch)

 Case 2 

 ![](./Assets/case%202%20switch)

## Result :

 ### Triangle Calculation ->

 ### Rectangle Calculation ->

 ### Non-stop calculation ->

 ## Releases Note

 V1.0

 This [versionv1.0]() was created to solve small problems and it could also run only one time. Then I tried to create non stop working in new version, are you ready to see it ...?

 V2.0 

This [version/v2.0]() is the ready framework to calculate the circle of Triangle and Perimeter of Rectangle . So it works continually, even if you don't click "n", it never stops to calculate again and again.

To get full information , please click the green word!!!

Thank you...
